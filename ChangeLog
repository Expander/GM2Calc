GM2Calc-0.2.12 [not released yet]

 * Change (commit 6205c0b): The strong gauge coupling g3 is now set to
   the non-zero PDG default value of 0.1184.

 * Change (commit 45b914c): The C++ user interface for changing the
   values of vu and vd has been simplified: Now the user only needs to
   set TB.  The VEV v = sqrt(vu^2 + vd^2) is calculated internally
   using the W and Z pole masses.

 * Change (commit 0659005): Regenerate default SLHA input file (CMSSM
   10.1.1, arXiv:1109.3859) with FlexibleSUSY 1.2.2.  Note: slightly
   updated SM input parameters are used compared to SoftSUSY's CMSSM
   10.1.1 version inOutFiles/lesHouchesInput .

 * Change (commit 5e993dd): 2-loop fermion/sfermion contributions from
   1st and 2nd generation sleptons have been added to Delta_g1 and
   Delta_g2 (Eq (6.6a) arxiv:1311.1775).  Patch: Dominik St√∂ckinger.

GM2Calc-0.2.11 [September, 24 2015]

 * Change (commit 16a8118): Don't throw an exception if gluino mass,
   M3, is zero, as it contributes at the 2-loop level.

 * Change (commit 53cbee3): Always print model parameters in verbose
   mode.  In addition, in verbose mode the DR-bar to on-shell
   conversion iteration steps are printed.

 * Change (commit 5854532): Replace Fortran implementation of Li2(z)
   by C++ implementation.  The C++ implementation is faster and
   eliminates the need of a Fortran compiler.

 * Change (commit d31daa0): Make use of LAPACK library optional.  By
   default the Eigen library is used for diagonalization of mass
   matrices.

 * Change (commit f105385): If SLHA input format has been chosen and
   no GM2CalcConfig input block is provided, the default output format
   will be SLHA and the value of amu will be written to the SPheno
   bock SPhenoLowEnergy[21].

 * Change (commit 3f6d5db): If the conversion of the right-handed
   soft-breaking smuon mass parameter from the DR-bar to OS scheme
   fails using a FPI, a root finding algorithm is tried.

 * Bugfix (commit 2f481f5): The sorting of the smuon pole masses got
   lost during the FPI, which lead to non-convergence of the
   right-handed soft-breaking smuon mass parameter with FPI.

 * Bugfix (commits 47c8237, bd15f57, 64cc024): Read DR-bar parameters
   from SLHA blocks with the same scale.  As renormalization scale the
   renormalization scale of the HMIX block is chosen.

GM2Calc-0.2.10 [September, 02 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit d4baa95): fix compilation with g++ 4.7.4

 * Feature (commit 8993e26): New flag GM2CalcConfig[4] to
   enable/disable verbose output.

 * Change: Nicer formatting of detailed output.

GM2Calc-0.2.9 [September, 01 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit 4a5725a): Use default muon mass if no muon mass is
   given in the SMINPUTS block.

 * Bugfix (commit c12dfe3): Refine and implement limits for the
   functions F*C, F*N, Fa, Fb and Iabc.  Patch: Markus Bach.

 * Bugfix (commit d3cc2de): Determine soft-breaking left-handed smuon
   mass parameter from the muon sneutrino pole mass.

 * Change (commit 6fc7ed4): add 2-loop 2L(a) corrections to best
   approximation for amu.  Patch: Markus Bach.

GM2Calc-0.2.8 [August, 06 2015]

 * Change (commit 2260ac4): If a physical problem has occured, the
   problem description is added to SPINFO[4] in case of
   SLHA-compliant output.

 * Feature (commit bfc22cc): Allow user to force output even if
   physical problem has been spotted.

GM2Calc-0.2.7 [August, 06 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit c514eca): Implementation of the limit x=1 for the
   functions F3C, F4C, F3N, F4N.

GM2Calc-0.2.6 [August, 06 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit e16898f): Implementation of the limit x=1 for the
   functions F1C, F2C, F1N, F2N.  Patch: Markus Bach.

GM2Calc-0.2.5 [August, 04 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit 8acb0b7): Make loop order selectable in case of
   minimal output.

 * Change: Do not print any output if the spectrum contains a tachyon.

GM2Calc-0.2.4 [August, 04 2015]

 * Bugfix: Implementation of functions Fa(x,y), Fb(x,y) and H2(x,y) in
   the limit x=1 and y=1.

 * Bugfix: Implementation of I(a,b,c) in the limit of equal arguments.
