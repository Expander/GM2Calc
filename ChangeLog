GM2Calc-1.1.3 [not released yet]

 * Feature (commit b65d75d): Adding C interface functions to
   retrieving warnings and problems in form of C strings.

 * Bugfix (commit 0665a09): Correcting the used sbottom masses in
   Delta_b corrections.

GM2Calc-1.1.2 [April, 08 2016]

 * Bugfix (commit a374bf7): Reformulate Delta_b corrections to avoid
   numerical problems when Mu, M3 or M1 are zero.

 * Bugfix (commit 4177460): Implement limits of Fa(), Fb() and
   amuBmuLmuR() functions when one or more masses go to zero.

GM2Calc-1.1.1 [March, 29 2016]

 * Bugfix (commit 9ca7890, 33e68a4, c047d46): Implement limit of
   Iabc() function when one or more masses go to zero.

GM2Calc-1.1.0 [December, 14 2015]

 * Change (commit 5cbbc50): The example programs have been moved to a
   separate examples/ directory.

 * Change (commit 873133f): Adding a C interface.  The new headers

      src/gm2_1loop.h
      src/gm2_2loop.h
      src/gm2_uncertainty.h
      src/MSSMNoFV_onshell.h

   declare C interface functions for GM2Calc routines.  In addition,
   two example C programs

      examples/example-gm2calc_c.c
      examples/example-slha_c.c

   have been added to illustrate the C interface.  These two C example
   programs behave exactly like their C++ counterparts.  They can be
   compiled by running `make examples'.

GM2Calc-1.0.0 [October, 29 2015]

 * Official release 1.0.0.

GM2Calc-0.2.17 [October, 26 2015]

 * Feature (commit 132851): The uncertainty of amu(2L,TB resummed) can
   be calculated by setting GM2CalcConfig[5] to 1.  Depending on the
   chosen output format (GM2CalcConfig[0]) the uncertainty is written

   as a single number to stdout   in case of minimal output,
   to the first line              in case of detailed output,
   to GM2CalcOutput[1]            in case of NMSSMTools output,
   to GM2CalcOutput[1]            in case of SPheno output,
   to GM2CalcOutput[1]            in case of GM2Calc output.

 * Feature (commit 02841d): A new SLHA-compliant output format
   "GM2Calc" has been added to avoid interference with SPheno or
   NMSSMTools: If GM2CalcConfig[0] is set to 4, the value of amu is
   written to GM2CalcOutput[0].  If uncertainty estimation has been
   enabled in addition, the uncertainty is written to
   GM2CalcOutput[1].

 * Feature (commits 25eee8d, 148adaf): Adding two C++ interface
   examples for the SLHA-compliant and the GM2Calc-specific input
   format.  The examples can be found in the files
   src/example-slha.cpp and src/example-gm2calc.cpp .

 * Change (commit 3bf585a): Memorize all tachyonic particles (not only
   one).

 * Change (commit af21077): Print warning if tachyons exist in
   detailed output without tan(beta) resummation.

 * Change (commits 1426497, f558f22): Reduce number of digits after
   the decimal point to 8 digits in the printed result for amu and its
   uncertainty.

 * Bugfix (commit 4b3f634): Check for tachyons if tan(beta)
   resummation is disabled.

GM2Calc-0.2.16 [October, 05 2015]

 * Change (commit 7a4f62a): The example input files have been renamed
   such that their file name extension reflects their input format.
   input/slha.in -> input/example.slha
   input/gm2calc.in -> input/example.gm2

 * Bugfix (commits e784353, c194f9c): Fix compilation problem with
   clang++ on Mac due to different STL implementation of std::conj().
   Thanks to Björn Sarrazin.

GM2Calc-0.2.15 [October, 01 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit 585614f): Be less strict in checking if scales of
   two SLHA blocks are the same, as SPheno might write the value of
   the scale with different numerical precision to the block header.
   Thanks to Björn Sarrazin.

GM2Calc-0.2.14 [September, 30 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit 53187a9): Fix compilation error with g++ 4.6.3.

GM2Calc-0.2.13 [September, 30 2015]

 * Change (commit 9230209): Print neutralino and chargino mixing
   matrices in verbose output.

 * Change (commit 810c56b): Use mb(MZ) in the DR-bar scheme instead of
   mb(mb) in the MS-bar scheme.

GM2Calc-0.2.12 [September, 27 2015]

 * Change (commit 6205c0b): The strong gauge coupling g3 is now set to
   the non-zero PDG default value of 0.1184.

 * Change (commit 45b914c): The C++ user interface for changing the
   values of vu and vd has been simplified: Now the user only needs to
   set TB.  The VEV v = sqrt(vu^2 + vd^2) is calculated internally
   using the W and Z pole masses.

 * Change (commit 0659005): Regenerate default SLHA input file (CMSSM
   10.1.1, arXiv:1109.3859) with FlexibleSUSY 1.2.2.  Note: slightly
   updated SM input parameters are used compared to SoftSUSY's CMSSM
   10.1.1 version inOutFiles/lesHouchesInput .

 * Change (commit 5e993dd): 2-loop fermion/sfermion contributions from
   1st and 2nd generation sleptons have been added to Delta_g1 and
   Delta_g2 (Eqs. (6.6a)-(6.6b) arxiv:1311.1775).  Patch: Dominik
   Stöckinger.

GM2Calc-0.2.11 [September, 24 2015]

 * Change (commit 16a8118): Don't throw an exception if gluino mass,
   M3, is zero, as it contributes at the 2-loop level.

 * Change (commit 53cbee3): Always print model parameters in verbose
   mode.  In addition, in verbose mode the DR-bar to on-shell
   conversion iteration steps are printed.

 * Change (commit 5854532): Replace Fortran implementation of Li2(z)
   by C++ implementation.  The C++ implementation is faster and
   eliminates the need of a Fortran compiler.

 * Change (commit d31daa0): Make use of LAPACK library optional.  By
   default the Eigen library is used for diagonalization of mass
   matrices.

 * Change (commit f105385): If SLHA input format has been chosen and
   no GM2CalcConfig input block is provided, the default output format
   will be SLHA and the value of amu will be written to the SPheno
   bock SPhenoLowEnergy[21].

 * Change (commit 3f6d5db): If the conversion of the right-handed
   soft-breaking smuon mass parameter from the DR-bar to OS scheme
   fails using a FPI, a root finding algorithm is tried.

 * Bugfix (commit 2f481f5): The sorting of the smuon pole masses got
   lost during the FPI, which lead to non-convergence of the
   right-handed soft-breaking smuon mass parameter with FPI.

 * Bugfix (commits 47c8237, bd15f57, 64cc024): Read DR-bar parameters
   from SLHA blocks with the same scale.  As renormalization scale the
   renormalization scale of the HMIX block is chosen.

GM2Calc-0.2.10 [September, 02 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit d4baa95): fix compilation with g++ 4.7.4

 * Feature (commit 8993e26): New flag GM2CalcConfig[4] to
   enable/disable verbose output.

 * Change: Nicer formatting of detailed output.

 * Bugfix (commit 4a5725a): Use default muon mass if no muon mass is
   given in the SMINPUTS block.

 * Bugfix (commit c12dfe3): Refine and implement limits for the
   functions F*C, F*N, Fa, Fb and Iabc.  Patch: Markus Bach.

 * Bugfix (commit d3cc2de): Determine soft-breaking left-handed smuon
   mass parameter from the muon sneutrino pole mass.

 * Change (commit 6fc7ed4): add 2-loop 2L(a) corrections to best
   approximation for amu.  Patch: Markus Bach.

GM2Calc-0.2.8 [August, 06 2015]

 * Change (commit 2260ac4): If a physical problem has occured, the
   problem description is added to SPINFO[4] in case of
   SLHA-compliant output.

 * Feature (commit bfc22cc): Allow user to force output even if
   physical problem has been spotted.

GM2Calc-0.2.7 [August, 06 2015]

 * Bugfix (commit c514eca): Implementation of the limit x=1 for the
   functions F3C, F4C, F3N, F4N.

 * Bugfix (commit 8acb0b7): Make loop order selectable in case of
   minimal output.

 * Change: Do not print any output if the spectrum contains a tachyon.

GM2Calc-0.2.4 [August, 04 2015]

 * Bugfix: Implementation of functions Fa(x,y), Fb(x,y) and H2(x,y) in
   the limit x=1 and y=1.

 * Bugfix: Implementation of I(a,b,c) in the limit of equal arguments.
