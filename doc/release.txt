GM2Calc release procedure
=========================

When releasing GM2Calc, please follow these steps:

 0. Checkout the master branch and merge all branches that should go
    into the release

      git co master

 1. Create a new commit with the updated version number in the
    Makefile and in the ChangeLog

      edit include/gm2calc/gm2_version.h
      edit ChangeLog
      git ci -a -m 'version <version>'

    <version> is of the form x.y.z with x = major, y = minor, z =
    patch level.

 2. Create a build directory and configure:

      mkdir build
      cd build
      cmake ..

 3. Create a non-annotated tag via

      make tag

 4. Create the release tarball and a corresponding .md5 file via

      make release-tag

 5. Push everything:

      git push origin master
      git push origin v<version>

    and copy the tarball and the .md5 file to Hepforge

      scp gm2calc-v<version>.tar.gz* \
         USERNAME@login.hepforge.org:/hepforge/home/gm2calc/downloads/
